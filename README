MakeUtilities

Some Java libraries for automatically generating Makefiles for C/C++ projects.

To compile, run "make", which will generate "make_utils.jar",
which you can use with your own Java programs to automate
the creation of Makefiles for large C/C++ projects.

Example programs will also be created during "make",
and are in the "examples" folder.

To compile class documentation, run "make docs",
which will generate documentations that you can access through "index.html".
