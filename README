MakeUtilities

Some Java libraries for automatically generating Makefiles for C/C++ projects.

To compile, run "make", which will generate "make_utils.jar",
which you can use with your own Java programs to automate
the creation of Makefiles for large C/C++ projects.

To compile class documentation, run "make docs",
which will generate documentations that you can access through "index.html".
